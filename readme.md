# Photography website - Adib Santos

## What is it?

This is aimed to the photography website I use to showcase my portfolio as well as a main website where clients could place orders to purchase prints of my photos. I have previously only displayed my work through Instagram, having a personal website will make my work more credible, proffesional and accesible. 

### Portrait photography 
Most of my paid work (with an exception of event/wedding photography) has been portrait photography.
This section of website will be used to showcase a gallery of my best portrait photography work. 

### Street photography 
Meant to showcase my work in different cities. Street photography captures candind,
spontaneus yet detailed stories in a way that no other type of photography can.

Both sections will be pretty similar in functionality. Users will be able to view galleries of each genre and click on specific images to view them individually and decide weather to purchase the print. Once the order is placed the user will be redirected to the 'orders' page, where they will be able to view their previous orders in chronological order.
