# Photography website - Adib Santos

## What is it?

This is aimed to the photography website I use to showcase my projects and portfolio as well as possibly getting new clients.
I have previously only gotten clients through the work I publish on Instagram, having a personal website will make my work more credible, proffesional and accesible. 

### Portrait photography 
Most of my paid work (with an exception of event/wedding photography) has been portrait photography.
This section of website will be used to showcase a gallery with no context or backstory of my work as a freelance portrait photographer. 

### Street photography 
Meant to showcase my work in different cities and the story behind them. Street photography captures candind,
spontaneus yet detailed stories in a way that no other type of photography can. This part of the website should be 
used as a storytelling section of my travels through my photographs. 

## Features for potential clients

+ Buying prints
    People will be able to buy prints of my street photography and order it directly to their homes. 

+ Booking me for portrait sessions  
    They will be able to directly book a time and a place for the photoshoot depending on my availability. (they will
    be able to see different prices depending on commuting time to the set location) Clients will
    be able to book me one week in advance. 

+ Setting up a 1x1 meeting before an event/wedding
    Meeting dedicated for the clients and myself to get to know each other and discuss logistics for the event/wedding. This can be in person or in a zoom call.
